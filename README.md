# Multi-label ICD-10 Classification
*Note that this project was done using Python 3.7.3*

*If you are experiencing issues, the Python version may be the problem.*

## What and why

The purpose of this project is to facilitate:


**(1)** training (fine-tuning) pre-trained BERT models and traditional supervised machine learning models using discharge summaries and diagnosis (ICD) codes, and

**(2)** evaluating how these trained models performs in pairing unseen discharge summaries with the correct ICD codes

## How to get hold of/prepare datasets

To obtain a valid dataset to use for training and testing the models use one of the two options below.

**(1)** Contact Hercules Dalianis at hercules@dsv.su.se to get hold of the Swedish EPR Gastro ICD-10 Pseudo Corpus containing approximately 6000 Swedish discharge summaries from 5000 patients.  

**(2)** If you want to train and test the models using your own data, the data needs to be in a csv file adhering to the following format:

***Column 1***: *Patient ID (optional)*


**Column 2**: Discharge summary


**Column 3â€“Column n**: One ICD code per column with values 0/1 representing whether the code is paired (1) or not (0) with the discharge summary

*n represents the number of ICD codes

*As indicated, patient ID is not necessary, but it is necessary that the discharge summaries are placed in the second column and that the ICD codes are placed in the third to the last colums.*

Below, you can see how the data should be structured

| *Patient ID*  | Discharge summary            | K00-K014    | K20-K31     |  ...         | K90-K93     |
| ------------- | -----------------------------| -----------:| -----------:| ------------:| -----------:|
| *41234131*    | Diagnosed liver cancer trea...| 1           | 0           | ...          | 1           |
| *65464366*    | Pat otherwise healthy came...| 0           | 1           | ...          | 0           |
| ...           | ...                          | ...         | ...         | ...          | ...         |
| *78676876*    | Chrons dis patient sent hom...| 1           | 0           | ...          | 0           |

Moreover, if you have your own dataset with other labels than the Swedish EPR Gastro ICD-10 Pseudo Corpus, you need to replace the already existing *labels.txt* with your own version of the file by listing the ICD codes in the order they appear in the dataset. For example, if your ICD codes consist of the ICD blocks in Chapter XI, the txt file should look like this

`K00-K14,K20-K31,K35-K38,K40-K46,K50-K52,K55-K64,K65-K67,K70-K77,K80-K87,K90-K93`

It is important that your file is named *labels.txt* and placed in the same place as the current file. 

## How to get started 


**(1)** Download this repository by opening the terminal/command prompt and changing your working directory to where you want to put the project 

`cd [filepath to folder where I want to put the project]`

For example, creating a folder on the desktop named my-ICD-project and entering

`cd Desktop/my-ICD-project`

Then, you clone the project by entering. Cloning is better than downloading as a zip file since that allows you to easily get (pull) the newest updates of the project.

`git clone https://github.com/sonjaremmer/icdcoder.git`

*Note: regarding to a new GitHub policy, when asked to enter your GitHub password, you should instead enter a personal access token which can be created by following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token*


**(2)** If you want to use BERT to do the ICD classification, download the BERT model pre-trained on Swedish texts, KB-BERT (bert-base-swedish-cased), by clicking on this link: https://s3.amazonaws.com/models.huggingface.co/bert/KB/bert-base-swedish-cased/pytorch_model.bin Put the *pytorch_model.bin* file in the folder *icdcoder/models/pre_trained_model*. It is important that the model file is named *pytorch_model.bin*. 

If you want another pre-trained model, you need to put the associated *config.json* and *vocab.txt* file in the *icdcoder/models/pre_trained_model* folder as well. This is not needed if you are working with *bert-base-swedish-cased* since those config and vocab files are already in the project folder. 


**(3)** If you want to access a KB-BERT model fine-tuned on pseudonymized Swedish discharge summaries (the Stockholm EPR Gastro ICD-10 Pseudo Corpus version 2), contact Hercules Dalianis at hercules@dsv.su.se and put the pytorch_model.bin file in the folder *icdcoder/models/fine_tuned_model*. It is important that the model file is named *pytorch_model.bin*.


**(4)** Change the working directory to the icdcoder repository by going to the terminal/command prompt and entering


`cd icdcoder`


***(4.5 optional step)*** *Create a virtual environment to work in. This step is preferable to not  
mess up other projects by installing the versions of the packages used in this project*

`python3 -m venv venv`

*Then, activate the virtual environment by entering*

`source venv/bin/activate`


**(5)** Make sure you have the right packages installed as specified in the requirements file by entering

`pip install --upgrade pip`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


**(6)** You are ready to train and/or evaluate your models. Follow the instructions in the sections below to do so


## Train/test BERT model

Now, you can **(i)** train the pre-trained BERT model, **(ii)**, train the BERT pre-trained model and evaluate the newly trained model, or **(iii)** use an already trained model to predict the ICD codes of an unseen discharge summary. This is done by entering 

`python3 BERT_coder.py` followed by one of the main arguments specified in the section *Training and testing using the main arguments* below.

*Note that for the commands to work, your working directory has to be the icdcoder folder. Print the working direktory by entering `pwd` and change it using `cd [filepath to icdcoder folder]`, for example `cd Desktop/my-ICD-project/icdcoder` Also, if you're using a virtual environment, it should be activated by entering `source venv/bin/activate`. Make sure you have the latest version by entering* `git pull`

### Training and testing using the main arguments

#### Training only

**(i)** `-train` 
                        Filepath to csv file used for training. The file
                        needs to follow the structure specified in the section *How to get hold of/prepare datasets*.

Train (fine-tune) using all of your dataset by using the entering


`python3 BERT_coder.py -train [filepath to data]`

For example

`python3 BERT_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv`


#### Training and Testing

**(ii)** `-train_and_test`
			Filepath to csv file used for training and
                        testing. The file needs to follow the structure
                        specified in the section *How to prepare dataset used for .

Train and evaluate by entering

For example

`python3 BERT_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_and_test_data.csv`

#### Testing only

**(iii)** `-test`    	Use argument if you want to predict the ICD
                	codes of an unseen discharge summary

Predict the ICD codes of a single discharge summary already trained (fine-tuned) model by entering


`python3 BERT_coder.py -test`

Nothing more than the argument itself is specified. After entering the line above, you will be asked to enter the discharge summary you want to predict the ICD codes for.


### Customize run using the optional arguments

*To get a description of all arguments in the terminal/command prompt, use the help argument by entering the following*

`python3 BERT_coder.py -h`

#### For -train, -train_and_test, or -test

### Examples of using main and optional arguments 

Below, examples of how to use the main and optional arguments with the BERT_coder.py script are displayed.

An example of how it could look like if you want to use all the data for training and not for testing, for example when wanting train a model to put in an application:

`python3 BERT_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv -pre_trained ./models/my_own_pre_trained_model -new_fine_tuned ./models/my_own_fine_tuned_model -epochs 15 -threshold 0.4 -batch_size_train 2 -gradient_accumulation 16 -learning_rate 1e-5 -warm_up 200 -random_state 123`

In this example, the file path to your training data is /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv, the filepath to the folder with your pre-trained model is ./models/my_own_pre_trained_model, and the folder that you want the new fine-tuned model to be placed has the filepath ./models/my_own_fine_tuned_model. You've set the number of epochs to 5, the binarizing threshold to 0.3, the training batch size to 2, the gradient accumulation to 16 (meaning your actual batch size is 2*16=32), the learning rate to 1e-5, the number of warm-up steps to 200, and the random state to 123. If you do not use any of the optional arguments and only specify the filepath to the training data, the default values of the optional arguments (see sections above) will be used. 

An example of how it could look like if you want to use the data for both training and testing, for example if you want to compare multiple classifiers using 30-fold cross-validation:

`python3 BERT_coder.py -train_and_test /Volumes/secretUSB/train_and_test_data.csv -pre_trained ./models/my_own_pre_trained_model -new_fine_tuned ./models/my_own_fine_tuned_model -epochs 5 -threshold 0.3 -batch_size_train 6 -gradient_accumulation 6 -learning_rate 3e-5 -warm_up 400 -random_state 321 -batch_size_test 4 -test_size 0.3 -kfold 30` 

Here, since -kfold is more than 1, k-fold cross-validation will be used, and the held out test-set (of size test_size) will be left untouched. If -kfold 0 or -kfold 1 is used, k-fold cross-validation will not be used and all training data (of size 1-test_size) will be used for training and the held-out test set (of size test_size) will be used for testing.

An example of how it could look like if you want to use the data for testing only. This is done if you already have a fine-tuned model and want to see how it performs on unseen discharge summaries:

`python3 BERT_coder.py -test -pre_trained ./models/my_own_pre_trained_model -fine_tuned ./models/my_own_fine_tuned_model/pytorch_model.bin -threshold 0.6 -batch_size_test 1`

When using the -test argument, a question will follow asking if you want to test a single discharge summary that you enter directly, or if you want to test discharge summaries in a csv file. If the latter is the case, the csv file should adhere to the format specified in the section *How to get hold of/prepare datasets*. 

## Train/evaluate traditional supervised machine learning models

You are also ready to train and evaluate traditional supervised machine learning models. As with the BERT model, you can also use traditional supervised machine learning models to **(i)** train, **(ii)**, train and evaluate the trained model, or **(iii)** use an already trained model to predict the ICD codes of an unseen discharge summary. This is done by entering 

`python3 baseline_coder.py` followed by one of the main arguments specified in the section *Training and testing using the main arguments* below.

*Note that for the commands to work, your working directory has to be the icdcoder folder. Also, if your using a virtual environment, it should be activated. If it was a while ago you cloned the repository, make sure you have the latest version by entering* `git pull`

### Training and testing using the main arguments

The main arguments are the same for the basline_coder.py as for the BERT_coder.py.

*Note that the arguments are mutually exclusive and one is required to run the baseline_coder.py script*


#### Training only

**(i)** `-train` 
                        Filepath to csv file used for training. The file
                        needs to follow the structure specified in the section *How to get hold of/prepare datasets*.

Train using all of your dataset by using the entering


`python3 baseline_coder.py -train [filepath to data]`

For example

`python3 baseline_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv`


#### Training and Testing

			                  Filepath to csv file used for training and
                        testing. The file needs to follow the structure
                        specified in the section *How to get hold of/prepare datasets*.

Train and evaluate by entering


`python3 baseline_coder.py -train_and_test [filepath to data]`

For example

`python3 baseline_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_and_test_data.csv`

#### Testing only

**(iii)** `-test`    	Use argument if you want to predict the ICD
                	    codes of an unseen discharge summary

`python3 baseline_coder.py -test`

Nothing more than the argument itself is specified. After entering the line above, you will be asked to enter the discharge summary you want to predict the ICD codes for.


### Customize run using the optional arguments

*To get a description of all arguments in the terminal/command prompt, use the help argument by entering the following*

`python3 baseline_coder.py -h`

#### For -train, -train_and_test, or -test

                        Filepath to txt file with stopwords. *Default is ./stopwords.txt*.


#### For -train or -train_and_test

  `-classifier` 
                        The desired classifier. Enter SVM, KNN or DT which represent Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neigbors, and Decision Trees. *Default is SVM*.

   `-new_trained_model` 
                        Filepath to new trained model. Default is *./models/new_baseline_model/ICD_model.sav*.

                        
   `-new_vectorizer` 
                        Filepath to new trained vectorizer. Default is *./models/new_baseline_model/vectorizer.sav*.               

   `-random_state` 
                        A seed (integer) to use as the random state when splitting the data. *Default is None*.     
                

#### For -train_and_test

   `-test_size` 
                        Fraction of data to use for testing. Must be between 0 and 1. *Default is 0.1*.               

   `-kfold` 
                        The number of folds (k) to use in k-fold cross-validation, must be > 1 for kfold to be used and *default is 10*     


#### For -test

   `-trained_model` 
                        Filepath to trained model. Note that if trained model is specified, the vectorizer needs to be specified as well. Default is *./models/trained_baseline_model/ICD_model.sav*.               

   `-vectorizer` 
                        Filepath to trained vectorizer. Note that if vectorizer is specified, the trained model needs to be specified as well. *Default is ./models/trained_baseline_model/vectorizer.sav*.    

### Examples of using main and optional arguments

Below, examples of how to use the main and optional arguments with the baseline_coder.py script are displayed.

An example of how it could look like if you want to use all the data for training and not for testing, for example when wanting train a model to put in an application:

`python3 baseline_coder.py -train /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv -new_trained_model ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_ICD_model.sav -new_vectorizer ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_vectorizer.sav -classifier DT -random_state 123 -stopwords ./my_own_stopwords.txt`

In this example, the file path to your training data is /Volumes/secretUSB/train_data.csv, the filepath to the new trained model is ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_ICD_model.sav, and the file path to the new trained vectorizer is ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_vectorizer.sav. The classifier is Decision Trees (DT), the random state to 123, and the filepath to your txt file with stopwords is ./my_own_stopwords.txt.

An example of how it could look like if you want to use the data for both training and testing, for example if you want to compare multiple classifiers using 30-fold cross-validation:

`python3 baseline_coder.py -train_and_test /Volumes/secretUSB/train_and_test_data.csv -new_trained_model ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_ICD_model.sav -new_vectorizer ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_vectorizer.sav -classifier KNN -random_state 321 -test_size 0.3 -kfold 30 -stopwords ./my_own_stopwords.txt` 

Here, since -kfold is more than 1, k-fold cross-validation will be used, and the held out test-set (of size test_size) will be left untouched. If -kfold 0 or -kfold 1 is used, k-fold cross-validation will not be used and all training data (of size 1-test_size) will be used for training and the held-out test set (of size test_size) will be used for testing. In this latter scenario, the trained model and vectorizer are saved. 

An example of how it could look like if you want to use the data for testing only. This is done if you already have a trained model and want to see how it performs on unseen discharge summaries:

`python3 baseline_coder.py -test -trained_model ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_ICD_model.sav -vectorizer ./models/my_own_new_baseline_model/my_own_vectorizer.sav -stopwords ./my_own_stopwords.txt`

When using the -test argument, a question will follow asking if you want to test a single discharge summary that you enter directly, or if you want to test discharge summaries in a csv file. If the latter is the case, the csv file should adhere to the format specified in the section *How to get hold of/prepare datasets*.
